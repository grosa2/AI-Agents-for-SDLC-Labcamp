Extract the values of response time from the input logs file. The value is the last number reported in each row

User
extract it for 100 rows, then use an anomaly detection algorithm to find anomalous values

User
do the same again, but this time report the timestamp corresponding to each response time (it is reported at the beginning of each row)

User
provide a line plot of the response times over time for the first 100 entries
